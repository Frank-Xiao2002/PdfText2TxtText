## Usage

- Use Ctrl+C to copy text to file _original.txt_, run the program,
  and check out the _output.txt_ for a '\n'-free text to directly
  copy to online translators, such as [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
- If you want to start a new paragraph, press Enter
  before the first word of the paragraph by yourself first, the program will
  remain the new line for you.

## Example

Input _original.txt_ like:

You will get _output.txt_ like the following:

Then you can copy the text in the _output.txt_ directly to online translation websites or Word document.

Check out the [_original.txt_](./original.txt) and [_output.txt_](./output.txt) as the above example.
