Programming is the activity of constructing a piece of formal text that is supposed to
instruct a computer how to fulfil certain tasks. Our intention is not to do that. What
we intend to build is a system within which there is a certain piece of software (the
one we shall construct), which is a component among many others. This is the reason
why our task is not limited to the software part only.

In doing this as engineers, we are not supposed to instruct a computer; rather, we are
supposed to instruct ourselves. To do this in a rigorous way, we have no choice but to
build a complete model of our future system, including the software that will eventually
be constructed, as well as its environment, which, again, is made of equipment, varying
physical phenomena, other software, and even users. Programming languages are of no
help in doing this. All this has to be carefully modeled so that the exact assumptions
within which our software is going to behave are known.

Modeling is the main task of system engineers. Programming then becomes a subtask
which might very well be performed automatically.

Computerized system modeling has been done in the past (and still is) with the help
of simulation languages such as SIMULA-67 (the ancestor of object-oriented programming
languages). What we propose here is also to perform a simulation, but rather
than doing it with the help of a simulation language, the outcome of which can be inspected
and analyzed, we propose to do it by constructing mathematical models which
will be analyzed by doing proofs. Physicists or operational researchers proceed in this
way. We will do the same.

Since we are not instructing a computer, we do not have to say what is to be done,
we have rather to explain and formalize what we can observe. But immediately comes
the question: how can we observe something that does not yet exist? The answer to
this question is simple: it certainly does not exist yet in the physical world, but, for
sure, it exists in our minds. Engineers or architects always proceed in this way: they
construct artefacts according to the pre-defined representation they have of them in
their minds.
